                <p>
                    Our mission-vision is to provide awareness to the people about the importance of the environment and what we can do to help. The environment in the Philippines is slowly getting worse and it is our responsibility to take good care of it. Little by little,
                    as the country grows, our environment declines. We would like to preserve the beauty this country has to offer and one of the way to do so is to be aware about the problem in our enviornment. Us being the next generation, we believe
                    it is our responsibility to know what help we can provide and to share the knowledge to others. Through this site, we hope to help out those who are less knowledgeable about the situation and motivate them to action.

                <p>
                    Our country has always been known for the tropical-relaxing sensation it gives starting from its astonishing islands up to its high mountainous regions. The warm welcome of sun perfectly fits the joyous Juan dela Cruz who are heads up high showing the
                    world how fun it is to be a Filipino.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But is it really 'always' about how fun it is to be in the Philippines? Obliterating the fact that 'relaxing' is slowly turning into 'devastating'? Air pollution here, Air pollution there. Oil spills on the corner and Trashes on the edge. For the past
                    ten years or even twenty, our environmental status comes from picture-perfect to devastation. The standard of beauty became shallow and Filipinos just accepted the bitter truth that the pearl of the orient turned into a cheap ruined
                    stone. This is the sad reality… and no one seems to care about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's take Baguio City as an example, considering it as the Summer Capital of the Philippines because of the pine trees wandering around the city and the soothing foggy mood it gives to one's senses. Unnoticeable that the actual temperature recorded from
                    the city ranges from 12-20 degree Celsius whenever in the year became too far when compared to present that it seems like it's considered as the "Summer Capital" oppositely because of the hot temperature it gives every day similar
                    to what we are experiencing during summer. Air pollution can be found everywhere in the city and it kills the fresh pine tree scent due to the number of vehicles that appears to be more than the number of residents. Trashes and plastics
                    that can be seen everywhere. Fog that is to be seen rarely when compared 10 years from now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's happening? That's all that they can say... And after that, they will eat their biscuits and throw their trashes anywhere, use plastics in every chances they can, cut trees and make amazing furniture of it, drive their vehicles even their destination
                    is near just to help air pollution grow and mostly, go to their beds and sleep tight at night without even realizing how they are contributing to the destruction of our treasure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Philippines... Our beloved Philippines... Our pearl of the orient... And our priceless treasure. Your furniture made out of trees won't be able to save her. Your vehicle can't driver her away from devastation. And your plastics can't cover her up to avoid
                    harmful effects of your doings. You, Me and Everyone. It is us who can save her and make it...

                Congratulations! You are indeed a Filipino! That’s how Filipinos barged in the <span class="highlight">3rd position in the whole world</span>  according to a study last 2016. This is not a ranking about the most beautiful country nor the most peaceful country.<span id="ranking"> It is the ranking for
                the top sources of <span class="highlight">scattered plastics </span>in the world.</span>
            </p>


            <p>
                It is disappointing to know that you still continued to read this as how it’s disappointing to admit the fact that signage are everywhere saying <span id="sign-1">“Do not throw garbage here!”,</span> <span id="sign-2">”Avoid using plastics!”,</span> <span id="sign-3">“Save mother earth!”</span> and yet we still managed to
                come up with almost 2.7 million metric tons of plastic each year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with this, it is very evident that the continuing scourge of disaster mitigation in every corner of our country slowly became unstoppable. And what do we do? Of course! Endlessly blame the government. Blame the president. Blame the law makers and
                sometimes even blame those people who never cared to our environment. But in the other hand, haven’t we ever thought of ourselves?

            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Flood</span> is the number one cause of this improper disposal of garbage. Not only in the lowlands but also slowly approaching Baguio City. Trashes clogged water drainages and then causes flooding that results to irritating disturbance to people’s life such
                as leptospirosis, dengue, fever, skin infections and hypothermia.
            </p>

            <p>
                In everything we do, it will bounce back to us. It will never be a one-sided reaction. . . NEVER.
            </p>

            <p>
                If we do not discipline ourselves, we are the ones who will suffer. If we neglect signage and warnings, we are the ones who will be neglected by disasters. And if we do not make a step now, our health will be stepped and stomped hardly by floods. So if
                you want these things to happen just ignore…. "Warning: Do not Read!

                        One of the damage caused to the environment that’s man-made would be soil pollution. This happens because of several reasons. One would be the not disposing of waste properly. There are times when trashes are being thrown to the land and some of this
                        has toxins and chemicals that seep into the land. This leads to the soil taking in those wastes that’s not good and can degrade it. Another similar reason to it is the leak of industrial waste. With the growth of economy comes
                        the increase of factories and this factories can leak out waste that are harmful to the soil. Pesticides too cause harm due to the chemical toxin they hold. Soil pollution can be harmful to us humans, especially with direct contact
                        or when we intake plants that grew on contaminated soils.

                        Water pollution is similar to soil pollution in which it is majorly caused by man-made waste. The improper way of disposing of trash can cause the contamination. Similarly, leakage of industrial waste has similar effects. Not only is it very harmful to
                        us humans but also any creature living in the water. This causes them to either die or force them to swim away and look for different area stay. Oil spillage is very harmful to the different species of creatures in the ocean and
                        from previous incidents, a lot of them died. With water pollution, it can harm us humans when we intake contaminated water, via direct contact or even eating seafood that were contaminated.

                        The highest cause of environmental degradation comes from air pollution. It is caused by the presence of harmful chemicals in the air. In modern society, air pollution usually comes from the vehicle and the emissions of factories. There are different
                        pollutants in the air, and of the most common is Carbon Dioxide (CO2). This CO2 is naturally found in the air, but if its concentrations are high, it causes greenhouse effect or global warming. According to experts, CO2 concentrations
                        increases for about 4% every year. And this is extremely damaging to health especially to children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2.4 million people die each year due to air pollution.

                        A type of pollution that although there are no physical attractions it can cause danger or nuisance in the affairs of humans and animals. In modern times, it typically comes from the line of transportation such as sound alarms, horns and exhaust system
                        of trains, motorcycles, cars and buses. Aircraft can also cause noise pollution not only to places which are near to airports but also on the routes of the plane itself. Factories can also cause noise pollution. Their machines,
                        trucks, and other equipment can disturb their surrounding area which usually are residential areas. On the other hand, residential areas can also cause noise pollution by entertainment and kitchen appliances such as televisions,
                        stereos, food processor, blender, and so on. Although usually marginalized, the effect of noise pollution is immense. The most common health effects, for example, is the loss of hearing. In fact, people who work in noisy places
                        usually have troubles hearing.

                        When the temperature of a natural body of water increases, aquatic plants and animals get affected by it and this is what you call thermal pollution. It is very similar to water pollution but the cause is heat. Thermal pollution is common in the Philippines
                        since our country is surrounded by large bodies of water. The largest source of thermal pollution are large plants and factories that use water from a natural resource as cooling agent and return it into the source with altered
                        temperature. More causes would be soil erosion, deforestation, and of course natural causes. This would be very bad for our environment since the Philippines’ aquatic life will be affected by a lot. There will be decreased DO (Dissolved
                        Oxygen) levels leading to the suffocation of aquatic plants and animals. The aquatic life of the Philippines might also die due to unnatural temperature or migrate to another location.

                        The Philippines is a very tropical country. In the provinces, you could see the starry night sky. Meanwhile in the cities, you will see a bright sky and this is due to light pollution. Man-made light has covered some parts of the Philippines and is gradually
                        moving on to the provinces. It will be harder to enjoy the starry night sky during family vacations or star gazing at night. All of this is due to man-made light such as street lamps, buildings tall enough that they shine light
                        all throughout the city and more.

                            Let's be straight. Keeping the green clean is not that difficult. Helping the environment stay clean is not a special kind of skill that one needs to master. It's simply just disciplining ourselves because a lot of the problem that degrades the beauty
                            of the environment is caused by us humans. We should remind ourselves on what can be done to help out. Here is a list of what we all can do.

                        We can all agree that no matter how beautiful a place is if there are trashes being littered around, that beauty is gone. The only way to solve this is to properly throw them in the right place. If you have any, look for any trash bin or similar container
                        on where you can throw it. Don't be one of those who will litter it just because they can't find any nearby. No matter how big or small it is, just hold on to it because it's your responsibility to throw your on trash properly.
                        And if you have to properly segregate your trash when you throw it then do it. It will help things stay organized.

                    If you have any trash that you know you can recycle then do it. If you are not very sure on how to recycle and/or which materials can be recycled then do the research. There are some that can be recycled and some that can't be like batteries, diapers,
                    paint and more so it's important to know which is which. If you have any recycling center in your area then try to save up some bottles and cans that can be returned because you can earn some money by returning them to the center in
                    some places. Keep in mind also that when you throw your trashes, some can be segregated to the recycle bin. Make sure to properly to throw it there.

                    <p class="guide-info">
                        There is never a case where there are too much trees especially in our generation where the city grows and the trees are being cut off. If you are not sure on how to do it or even where to start, find a community/group that can help with that or even
                        charity works. Cutting down trees can lead to deforestation, erosion of soil, and extinction of species because of the effect of losing their habitat. This can also lead to the increase of the amount of greenhouse gas that will
                        be released to the atmosphere due to less trees being able to take in the carbon dioxide.

                        This might not be easy for those who stay in cities where getting from one location to another takes a long time but driving less does help with the environment. Cars produce carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide which causes air pollution. Not only is it
                        affecting the environment but also us humans. As much as possible find eco-friendly ways of transportations like riding bikes or just simply walking, especially if your destination is not that far from where you are. If you are
                        one of those who can afford an electronic car then go for it. It will help a lot.

                        It's a good if you understand how our environment can be affected by the things we do to it but it's not enough if it's only you who is aware of it. Spread the awareness to those who don't know. Let them know and guide them on what they can do so they
                        can do the same to help keep things clean. If you have any nearby community that helps spread the awareness, try joining them and give them a hand. The more people know what can be done to help the better.

                    <p class="guide-info">
                        Being consistent is an important thing that one must always remember. You may know the importance of keeping the environment clean and how you can do it but if you are not consistent on doing what can be done to help out then it's pointless. You may be
                        helping out for a month, a week, or day and that's not enough. You need to be consistent and do it as long as possible. Even if it's simple as throwing your trash properly, just do it. Be consistent. Don't make excuses and do something
                        that you know won't be good for the environment. It's better to do things right as early as possible than to do it when the problem gets bigger.
