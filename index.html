                <h1>FORGOTTEN BEAUTY</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                Our country has always been known for the tropical-relaxing sensation it gives starting from its astonishing islands up to its high mountainous regions. The warm welcome of sun perfectly fits the joyous Juan dela Cruz who are heads up high showing the
                world how fun it is to be a Filipino.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                But is it really 'always' about how fun it is to be in the Philippines? Obliterating the fact that 'relaxing' is slowly turning into 'devastating'? Air pollution here, Air pollution there. Oil spills on the corner and Trashes on the edge. For the past
                ten years or even twenty, our environmental status comes from picture-perfect to devastation. The standard of beauty became shallow and Filipinos just accepted the bitter truth that the pearl of the orient turned into a cheap ruined stone.
                This is the sad reality… and no one seems to care about it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Let's take Baguio City as an example, considering it as the Summer Capital of the Philippines because of the pine trees wandering around the city and the soothing foggy mood it gives to one's senses. Unnoticeable that the actual temperature recorded from
                the city ranges from 12-20 degree Celsius whenever in the year became too far when compared to present that it seems like it's considered as the "Summer Capital" oppositely because of the hot temperature it gives every day similar to what
                we are experiencing during summer. Air pollution can be found everywhere in the city and it kills the fresh pine tree scent due to the number of vehicles that appears to be more than the number of residents. Trashes and plastics that can
                be seen everywhere. Fog that is to be seen rarely when compared 10 years from now.

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                What's happening? That's all that they can say... And after that, they will eat their biscuits and throw their trashes anywhere, use plastics in every chances they can, cut trees and make amazing furniture of it, drive their vehicles even their destination
                is near just to help air pollution grow and mostly, go to their beds and sleep tight at night without even realizing how they are contributing to the destruction of our treasure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Philippines... Our beloved Philippines... Our pearl of the orient... And our priceless treasure. Your furniture made out of trees won't be able to save her. Your vehicle can't driver her away from devastation. And your plastics can't cover her up to avoid
                harmful effects of your doings. You, Me and Everyone. It is us who can save her and make it...
            </p>

        <div id="guide-intro-details">
            <p>
                Let's be straight. Keeping the green clean is not that difficult. Helping the environment stay clean is not a special kind of skill that one needs to master. It's simply just disciplining ourselves because a lot of the problem that degrades the beauty
                of the environment is caused by us humans. We should remind ourselves on what can be done to help out. Here is a list of what we all can do.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="guide-1">
        <h3 class="guide-header">1. Throw trashes properly</h3>
        <p class="guide-info">
            We can all agree that no matter how beautiful a place is if there are trashes being littered around, that beauty is gone. The only way to solve this is to properly throw them in the right place. If you have any, look for any trash bin or similar container
            on where you can throw it. Don't be one of those who will litter it just because they can't find any nearby. No matter how big or small it is, just hold on to it because it's your responsibility to throw your on trash properly. And if you
            have to properly segregate your trash when you throw it then do it. It will help things stay organized.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="guide-2">
        <h3 class="guide-header">2. Recycle</h3>
        <p class="guide-info">
            If you have any trash that you know you can recycle then do it. If you are not very sure on how to recycle and/or which materials can be recycled then do the research. There are some that can be recycled and some that can't be like batteries, diapers,
            paint and more so it's important to know which is which. If you have any recycling center in your area then try to save up some bottles and cans that can be returned because you can earn some money by returning them to the center in some places.
            Keep in mind also that when you throw your trashes, some can be segregated to the recycle bin. Make sure to properly to throw it there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="guide-3">
        <h3 class="guide-header">3. Plant more trees</h3>
        <p class="guide-info">
            There is never a case where there are too much trees especially in our generation where the city grows and the trees are being cut off. If you are not sure on how to do it or even where to start, find a community/group that can help with that or even
            charity works. Cutting down trees can lead to deforestation, erosion of soil, and extinction of species because of the effect of losing their habitat. This can also lead to the increase of the amount of greenhouse gas that will be released
            to the atmosphere due to less trees being able to take in the carbon dioxide.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="guide-4">
        <h3 class="guide-header">4. Drive less</h3>
        <p class="guide-info">
            This might not be easy for those who stay in cities where getting from one location to another takes a long time but driving less does help with the environment. Cars produce carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide which causes air pollution. Not only is it
            affecting the environment but also us humans. As much as possible find eco-friendly ways of transportations like riding bikes or just simply walking, especially if your destination is not that far from where you are. If you are one of those
            who can afford an electronic car then go for it. It will help a lot.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="guide-5">
        <h3 class="guide-header">5. Help spread the awareness</h3>
        <p class="guide-info">
            It's a good if you understand how our environment can be affected by the things we do to it but it's not enough if it's only you who is aware of it. Spread the awareness to those who don't know. Let them know and guide them on what they can do so they
            can do the same to help keep things clean. If you have any nearby community that helps spread the awareness, try joining them and give them a hand. The more people know what can be done to help the better.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="guide-6">
        <h3 class="guide-header">6. Be CONSISTENT</h3>
        <p class="guide-info">
            Being consistent is an important thing that one must always remember. You may know the importance of keeping the environment clean and how you can do it but if you are not consistent on doing what can be done to help out then it's pointless. You may be
            helping out for a month, a week, or day and that's not enough. You need to be consistent and do it as long as possible. Even if it's simple as throwing your trash properly, just do it. Be consistent. Don't make excuses and do something that
            you know won't be good for the environment. It's better to do things right as early as possible than to do it when the problem gets bigger.
